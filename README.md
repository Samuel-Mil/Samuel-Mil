### About Me:
I am a fullstack developer focused on PHP and Java ecosystems, working primarily with frameworks such as Laravel and Spring Boot. On the front-end, I specialize in Vue.js, building responsive and dynamic web applications.

Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, where I actively participate in internal university projects involving artificial intelligence and web development. I am also a member of the university's in-house startup team, contributing to real-world solutions in a collaborative environment.

I am particularly interested in fast-paced and innovative projects, especially within startup contexts. I enjoy working on open-source and personal projects that allow me to explore new technologies and improve my development skills.

At the moment, I am expanding my knowledge in cloud computing and DevOps.<br><br><br>
