### About Me:
I am a Software Engineer working primarily with PHP and Java stacks and Cloud Computing techs like Linux, Docker and AWS. I specialize in webs systems working as fullstack developer and project manager in some products, building reliable web applications.

Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, where I actively participate in internal university projects involving artificial intelligence and web development. I am also a member of the university's in-house startup team, contributing and guiding to real-world solutions in a collaborative environment.

I am particularly interested in fast-paced and innovative projects, especially within startup contexts. I enjoy working on open-source and personal projects that allow me to explore new technologies and improve my development skills.

At the moment, I am expanding my knowledge in Cloud Computing and DevOps.<br><br><br>
